# Road Detection using OpenCV
Did some research a few years back when I had to drive through a rainstorm and couldn't see the road. The goal of this project was to make a hypothetical augmented reality windshield that a user could be able to switch on and off if needed for assitance. It aimed to detect and visualize lane lines in images/videos/live by applying edge detection, focusing on a region of interest, and then identifying and drawing the lanes using Hough Line Transform. I did use imports from another project but the files were too large so the .env and video files are missing. Nontheless, I only made it to processing images and videos but never live as I realized the outcome of that would require a different approach and more hardware. It also did not work as I wished but it did yield results.
